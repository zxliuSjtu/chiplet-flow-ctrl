# Chiplet Flow Control
## Overview
This is the source code of gem5 with: Chiplet Flow Control Network on Chip.

In Order to provide a **High-performance Deadlock-free** NoC service in situation of **Chiplet-based architecture**, the following part of NoC is redesigned:
- A three-stage routing algorithem is proposed
- A mirco-architecture of routers is redesinged
- A protocol to estabulish a fast transport channel bufferlessly
- to be continued...

## Baseline Topology

## Three-stage routing algorithem
